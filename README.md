---

### ⚙️ Configure the Environment

1. In the project folder, locate:

   ```bash
   .env.demo
   ```

2. Create a copy named:

   ```bash
   .env
   ```

3. If you are comfortable with Docker and wish to customise the configurations, Open `.env` using your favorite text editor.

4. You can adjust values for your needs (look at `.env.docs` file that describe configurations).

```env
#file checker API configuration
FILECHECKERAPI_IMAGE=ghcr.io/oneargo/argoformatchecker/python-api
FILECHECKERAPI_IMAGE_TAG=latest

#decoder API configuration
ARGODECODERAPI_IMAGE=boilerplateapi # to change with decoder image
ARGODECODERAPI_IMAGE_TAG=latest
DECODER_USER_UID=1000
DECODER_USER_GID=1000

#jupyterlab configuration :
JUPYTERLAB_IMAGE=quay.io/jupyter/datascience-notebook
JUPYTERLAB_IMAGE_TAG=python-3.13
JUPYTER_USER_UID=1000

#webserveur NGINX configuration
WEBSERVER_HOST="127.0.0.1"
WEBSERVER_PORT=8080

#Configure which service to enable (decoder,checker,jupyter) separated by a comma. will be run with 'docker compose up'
COMPOSE_PROFILES=decoder,checker,jupyter
```

Webserver will always be enabled as it is necessary to access others services.

<span style="color:darkorange">
Warning : An issue prevents the web server from starting if the Jupyter service is not running. For the moment keep `jupyter` in the list of services in `COMPOSE_PROFILES`.
</span>

The `argo_nginx.conf.template` file is needed and **must not** be changed.

### ▶ Launch Services (No Terminal Expertise Needed)

You can run the Toolbox API locally using either podman Desktop or Docker Desktop.
Pick the option that matches what you installed on your computer.

💼 Before running the containers you will need the following.

- Clone of the Argo toolbox repository.
- All the configuration setup correctly.
- Docker desktop or podman desktop installed.

if you do not have the repository containing the toolbox please clone it.

---

#### If using podman desktop

1. Launch podman desktop
2. You will notice a compose.yml in the toolbox.
   Run the following command in a terminal to pull all the required images.

   ```bash
   podman compose --file compose.yaml up --detach
   ```

3. You can view all the containers in the podman desktop. The desktop detects the compose labels and displays the container group or group of containers.
   for example
   ![alt text](/assets/images/podman.png)
4. If the containers have not started click on the 'play'⏯️ icon against the container.
5. Alternatively to stop any container click on the 'stop'⏹️ icon
6. If you wish to delete a container or a group of containers, click the delete icon(🗑) for that container.
7. Viewing logs or accessing a container terminal.

   Click on the container you want to inspect.

   Four tabs will appear: Summary, Logs, Inspect, and Terminal.

   - Click Logs to view the container’s log output.
   - Click Terminal if you want to open a shell inside the container to interact with it directly.

#### If using Docker desktop

1. Open Docker Desktop

   Launch Docker Desktop and wait until it shows:

   ```text
   Docker Desktop — Running
   ```

2. Open the _Containers_ view

   In the left sidebar, click:

   **Containers → [your-repo-name]**

   You should see a list of services defined in `compose.yaml`.

3. Start all services

Next to the project name, click:

👉 **▶ Start**

Docker Desktop will:

- pull the container images (first time only)
- start all services listed in `compose.yaml`
- show green “Running” indicators

4.  Check that everything is running

Each service should display:

- a **green dot**
- a **Running** status

You can click any container to view logs, ports, and details.

![alt text](/assets/images/image-1.png)

5.  Stop all services

To stop everything safely, click:

👉 **⏹ Stop**

6.  Restart if needed

You can restart the entire stack by clicking:

👉 **⟳ Restart**

#### 💡 Optional: Command Line (for advanced users)

##### 🚀 Launch services

If you prefer using a terminal:

Launch all services :

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

View services status :

```bash
docker compose ps
```

You should see something like that :
![alt text](/assets/images/image-2.png)

Stop services :

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

##### 🛑 Troubleshooting docker

###### View logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

This will display the logs of all the containers and the flag -f will keep streaming the output as logs appear

###### Restart everything

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

###### Check container status

```bash
docker compose ps
```

---

## Accessing Services

Once started, services are accessible at (considering the port configured in `.env` file, 8080 in .env.demo provided):

- **Decoder API**: <http://localhost:8080/argo-toolbox/api/decoder>
- **File Checker API**: <http://localhost:8080/argo-toolbox/api/file-checker>
- **JupyterLab**: <http://localhost:8080/argo-toolbox/jupyterlab>
- **Home page**: <http://localhost:8080/>

### Using Decoder

To be completed....

### Using Argo Netcdf File Checker

The file checker endpoint will then be available on <http://localhost:8080/argo-toolbox/api/file-checker/check-files> (POST method).

The DAC for the files needs to be specified as a parameter and the files to check need to be included in the body of a `multipart/form-data` type request, e.g.

For example, post a file to `http://localhost:8080/argo-toolbox/api/file-checker/check-files?dac=coriolis`.

Example files can be found <https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoFormatChecker/tree/main/demo/inputs>

```http request
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/argo-toolbox/api/file-checker/check-files?dac=coriolis' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'files=@2903996_meta.nc'
```

### 🧪 Using JupyterLab

JupyterLab gives you an interactive Python workspace.

The following assumes that the services (file checker, decoder) required for your various notebooks are started.

#### Open JupyterLab

Navigate to: <http://localhost:8080/argo-toolbox/jupyterlab>

In the case it asks you a password, you will need to consult the juypyterLab container's logs :

- go to Docker Desktop, containers and click on the Jupyterlab.

or

- use the following command :

```bash
docker compose logs -f jupyterlab
```

In the first lines of logs when the container started, you should see a link of the jupyterlab's path along with a token. Use this link to connect to Jupyterlab. Example (be aware that the token change at each run) :

![alt text](/assets/images/image-4.png)

Then It should open automatically in your browser :

![alt text](/assets/images/image.png)

#### 📂 Example Notebooks

The project includes in examples/notebooks notebooks demonstrating:

- Working with Git LFS data
- Decoding source files
- Validating Argo NetCDF files

#### 🔄 Pull large Git LFS data

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

---

#### 📦 Installing extra Python packages

Inside JupyterLab:

1. Open a **Terminal**
2. Run:

```bash
pip install <package-name>
```

Packages are installed **inside the container**, not on your Windows system.
